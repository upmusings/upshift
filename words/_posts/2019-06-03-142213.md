On the subject of using math to justify design choices, I like [Matthew Butterick's stance](https://practicaltypography.com/headings.html) × 1.61803398875:
> The risk with these shortcuts is that they encourage typographers to satisfy themselves with numerical justifications—**I used the golden ratio**, therefore it must look good!—at the expense of developing visual judgment. When your headings look right, they are right—and if so, the ratio matters not a whit.
