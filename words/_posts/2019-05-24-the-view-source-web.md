Being able to peak under the hood, tinker and figure out how it all worked was what got me started as a web developer. Come to think of it, it is still how I learn and work. I'm afraid we might be losing some of that on the web, however.

Brent Simmons [put it nicely](https://inessential.com/2018/04/15/the_view_source_web) when he said:

I guess part of this over-complication and inadvertent obfuscation might come from the fact that we are pushing the web to—and maybe beyond—its limits. I say that like it is a bad thing, and maybe it is, but mostly I just don't know.

I just hope that there are still websites out there with clean markup, sane stylesheets and intelligible JavaScript. My web development depends on it.
